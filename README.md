### General Introduction
Sediment dynamics play a crucial role in shaping riverine and coastal environments, influencing channel morphology, habitat suitability, and sediment delivery to downstream ecosystems. Grain-size distribution, sediment transport rates, and hydraulic characteristics are interrelated parameters essential for understanding sediment mobility and morphodynamic changes. Quantifying these parameters allows scientists and engineers to predict sediment response to natural and anthropogenic alterations, such as dam removal, climate variability, and land-use changes.

This study integrates granulometric data from usSEABED (Pacific Parsed data) and hydrologic measurements from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to provide a multi-scale understanding of sediment processes. The analysis emphasizes relationships among grain size (D50), flow velocityâ€“discharge scaling, and bedload transport patterns over time. Such insights are critical for sediment management strategies and restoration projects, particularly in dynamic systems like the Elwha River following dam removal.
